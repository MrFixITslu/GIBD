## 🌐 Netlify Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
```bash
# In Netlify Dashboard: Site Settings > Environment Variables
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
JWT_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-here
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yoursite.netlify.app
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-key-here
```

### 2. Deploy Settings
- Build command: `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] All pages accessible
- [ ] API calls work (check Network tab)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile view functions properly

## 🚨 Rollback Plan
- [ ] Previous working deployment identified
- [ ] Database backup available
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

## 📞 Production Monitoring
- [ ] Error monitoring setup (optional: Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Performance monitoring configured
- [ ] Analytics tracking implemented (optional)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring setup

## 🎯 Launch Day Protocol
