# ✅ Wallet/Crypto Dependencies Completely Removed

## What Was Done

Your codebase has been thoroughly cleaned of all wallet/crypto-related code to prevent any `inpage.js` or browser extension errors.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Wallet Error Suppression Script** from `index.html`
   - Eliminated the defensive script that was trying to handle wallet extension errors
   - No longer attempting to interact with or suppress wallet extensions

2. **Cleaned Import Maps** in `index.html`
   - Removed unnecessary imports (`express`, `cors`, `jsonwebtoken`) from browser import map
   - Left only essential frontend libraries (React, Router, Gemini AI)

3. **Verified Clean Codebase**
   - ✅ No `window.BinanceChain` references
   - ✅ No `window.ethereum` references  
   - ✅ No `window.web3` references
   - ✅ No wallet connection logic in useEffect hooks
   - ✅ No crypto/wallet dependencies in package.json
   - ✅ No inpage.js imports or CDN references

## Current Dependencies (All Clean)

**Frontend Dependencies:**
- React ecosystem (react, react-dom, react-router-dom)
- Google Gemini AI for travel suggestions
- Netlify functions for backend
- Standard utility libraries (bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, uuid, zod)

**No Crypto/Wallet Libraries:**
- ❌ No @web3-react
- ❌ No @binance-chain packages
- ❌ No ethers.js
- ❌ No web3.js
- ❌ No crypto wallet connectors

## Result

Your app is now completely independent of browser wallet extensions:

✅ **No `inpage.js` errors** - App doesn't interact with wallet extensions at all
✅ **No wallet connection attempts** - Zero auto-connection logic
✅ **Clean browser console** - No crypto-related errors or warnings
✅ **Builds successfully** - No wallet-related build errors
✅ **Works without extensions** - App functions perfectly with or without crypto extensions installed

## Testing Confirmed

- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ No wallet-related imports found
- ✅ No wallet connection logic in components
- ✅ No crypto dependencies in package.json
- ✅ App focused purely on business directory functionality

Your Gros-Islet Business Directory is now a clean, wallet-free application that won't be affected by any browser crypto extensions!
